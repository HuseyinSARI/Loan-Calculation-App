# Loan Calculation App

This project made for "Fimple React Pratictum" organized by Patika.dev.

You can run this application by typing ### `npm start` on the command line.

It calculates by entering the loan amount, interest and installment information to be used. Using this data, you can calculate the installment amount, the interest you will pay and the detailed repayment schedule.

You can watch the short video I prepared about this application.
